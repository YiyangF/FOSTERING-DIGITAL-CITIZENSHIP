## Problem Statement

Australian parents of children aged 7–16 are increasingly concerned about their kids’ safety online, particularly regarding cyberbullying and inappropriate digital behavior.

Existing digital education programs are often too generic, not tailored to parents, and fail to offer practical guidance or tools. Many parents also lack the necessary digital literacy to confidently support or educate their children.

As a result, they struggle to monitor, respond, and guide their children’s digital life effectively.

### Our Goal:
To create a comprehensive, interactive web platform that empowers parents with the knowledge, tools, emotional awareness, and community support needed to raise safe, confident, and digitally responsible children.
